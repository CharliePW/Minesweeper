# Minesweeper

## Description

Minesweeper is a simple single-person game where the player is shown a grid and the aim is to find all the mines on the grid. In some of the nodes there are numbers, these numbers represents how many mines there are adjacent to that node.

## Gameplay

My adaptation of the game is a simple command line interface where the grid is displayed and you manually enter the coordinares of the node you chose and whether or not you want to flag it. You can also chose the difficulty of the game "Easy", "Medim" or "Hard" which affects the number of mines in the grid.

## How to run the code

Since this game engine is written in java, you must have a working version of java downloaded, or an IDE that supports it (such as BlueJ). To compile the code type "javac Game.java" in the command line and "java Game.java" to run the code.
